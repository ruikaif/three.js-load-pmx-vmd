Thank you for 50 subscribers! Even though 50 is a small number it really means a lot. So here are 3 motions as a thank you for that.

You don't have to credit me for the motions, but DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT CLAIM ANY MOTIONS I RELEASE AS YOUR OWN! It's simply all I ask from you guys. I don't wanna have any trouble.

Thank you guys for helping me get this far I hope to keep making more motions and getting better at making them too. I also want to do collabs too. 

I hope to actually start recording gaming videos with my friends and start live streaming with them at some point.
